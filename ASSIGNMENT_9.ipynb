    "Abstraction is one of the key principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows us to represent complex real-world entities as simplified and manageable objects. It involves hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features or behaviors of an object to the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It may contain one or more abstract methods, which are declared but not implemented in the abstract class. Subclasses derived from an abstract class must provide the implementation for the abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate abstraction in OOP using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",

    "\n",
    "circle = Circle(4)\n",
    "print(circle.calculate_area())  # Output: 50.24\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we have an abstract class Shape that defines the concept of a shape and declares the abstract method calculate_area(). The abstract method is meant to calculate the area of a shape but doesn't provide an implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rectangle and Circle classes are concrete implementations of the Shape abstract class. They provide their own implementations of the calculate_area() method based on the specific formulas for calculating the areas of rectangles and circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing abstraction, we can define a common interface (calculate_area()) that all shapes must have, while allowing each shape to implement the calculation according to its own rules. This way, the user of the classes doesn't need to worry about the internal details of how each shape's area is calculated. They can simply interact with the shapes using the common interface provided by the abstract class.\n",

The Dog and Cat classes are concrete implementations of the Animal abstract class. They provide their own implementations of the make_sound() method based on the specific sounds dogs and cats make.

    "Encapsulation focuses on bundling data and methods together within a class and restricting direct access to the internal data.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Direct access to the private attribute is restricted\n",
    "print(account.__balance)  # Output: AttributeError: 'BankAccount' object has no attribute '__balance'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the BankAccount class encapsulates the account number and balance as private attributes (self.__balance). Access to these attributes is controlled through the public methods deposit(), withdraw(), and get_balance().

    "In Python, the abc module stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides mechanisms for defining abstract base classes in Python. An abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be subclassed by other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module is used to create abstract base classes and enforce certain rules or structures that subclasses must adhere to. Abstract base classes allow you to define common interfaces or behaviors that multiple subclasses should implement, ensuring consistency and providing a way to define shared methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few use cases for the abc module:\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining interfaces: Abstract base classes can define a set of methods that subclasses must implement. This allows you to define an interface that multiple classes should conform to, ensuring that they provide certain functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcing subclass structure: Abstract base classes can define specific methods that subclasses must implement or inherit from superclasses. This helps in enforcing a particular structure or hierarchy among the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Abstract base classes facilitate polymorphism by providing a common API that subclasses can adhere to. This allows you to write code that operates on the abstract base class, without needing to know the specific implementation of each subclass.\n",
    "\n",

    "Data abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that aims to hide the implementation details of data and provide a simplified interface for interacting with it. It allows you to focus on the essential properties and behaviors of an object while hiding the underlying complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can achieve data abstraction through classes and objects. Here are some techniques to implement data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods together within a class. By defining class attributes and methods as either public, protected, or private, you can control the access to the internal data of the class. Public attributes and methods are accessible from outside the class, protected attributes and methods have limited access, and private attributes and methods are only accessible within the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessors and Mutators: Accessors (also called getters) and mutators (also called setters) are methods that provide controlled access to the class attributes. Accessors allow you to retrieve the values of attributes, while mutators enable you to modify the attribute values. By using accessors and mutators, you can enforce validation, perform calculations, or apply additional logic when accessing or modifying the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction through Interfaces: Interfaces define a contract specifying a set of methods that a class must implement. By defining abstract base classes or interfaces, you can establish a common interface for a group of related classes. This allows you to interact with objects based on their shared interface rather than their specific implementations, promoting abstraction and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Hiding: Information hiding refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the essential information through public interfaces. It helps in reducing complexity and allows you to change the internal implementation without affecting the code that relies on the public interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these techniques, you can achieve data abstraction in Python and create classes that provide a simplified and controlled interface for interacting with data, hiding the underlying implementation details. This promotes code maintainability, reusability, and modular design.\n",

    "\n",
    "The abc module in Python provides the ABC (Abstract Base Class) metaclass, which allows you to define abstract base classes. To create an abstract class, you need to use the abc.ABC class as the base class for your class and use the @abstractmethod decorator on any methods you want to declare as abstract.\n",
